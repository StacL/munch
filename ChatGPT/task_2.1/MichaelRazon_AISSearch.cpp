/*  getNextField -
        Parses through the line of comma separated values for the next value and storing it as a substring
    parameters - 
        string &line - line of comma separated values containing data to be put in field members of vessel
        int &index - tells the function where to look in the line for the value
        string &subString - holds each character read through until a comma or the line length is found
    return values - 
        return the modified index by reference so the next time the function is called, it will know where
        to start looking in the line. return the subString by reference to be saved into the vessel's record.
        return false if a comma is found and the line is not done being parsed. return true if the line is 
        done being parsed.
    Algorithm - 
        Use a while-loop to parse through the line. If the character of the current index is not a comma (the 
        delimiter) and is not the last index of the line, then the character must be part of the current value
        being read. Concatenate the substring with the character. Otherwise, if the current character is a comma,
        incremement the index to prepare for the next function call and return false to indicate the line still
        needs to be parsed. If the end of the line is reached, exit the while-loop and return true to indicate the 
        line is finished being parsed.
